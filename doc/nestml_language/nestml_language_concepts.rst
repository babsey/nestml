NESTML language concepts
========================


Structure and indentation
-------------------------

NESTML uses Python-like indentation to group statements into blocks. Leading white spaces (spaces or tabs) determine the level of indentation. There is no prescribed indentation depth, as long as each individual block maintains a consistent level. To indicate the end of a block, the indentation of subsequent statements (after the block) must again be on the same indentation level as the code before the block has started. The different kinds of blocks can be :ref:`Functions`, :ref:`Control structures`, or any of the block in :ref:`Block types`. As an example, the following neuron model is written with our recommended indentation level of 4 spaces:

.. code-block:: nestml

   model test_neuron:
       state:
           foo integer = 42
           bar s = 0 s

       update:
           if foo > 42:
               bar += 1 ms
           else:
               bar -= 1 ms

Similar to Python, a single line can be split into multiple lines by using a backslash (``\``). For example, the expression in the ``update`` block of the model below is split into multiple lines using this technique.

.. code-block:: nestml

   model test_neuron:
       state:
           tau ms = 42 ms
           foo s = 0 s

       update:
           foo = tau > 0 \
               ? foo + 1 \
               : foo - 1


Data types and physical units
-----------------------------

Data types define types of variables as well as parameters and return values of functions. NESTML provides the following primitive types and physical data types:

Primitive data types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``real`` corresponds to the ``double`` data type in C++. Example literals are: ``42.0``, ``-0.42``, ``.44``
-  ``integer`` corresponds to the ``long`` data type in C++. Example literals are: ``42``, ``-7``
-  ``boolean`` corresponds to the ``bool`` data type in C++. Its only literals are ``true`` and ``false``
-  ``string`` corresponds to the ``std::string`` data type in C++. Example literals are: ``"Bob"``, ``""``, ``"Hello World!"``
-  ``void`` corresponds to the ``void`` data type in C++. No literals are possible and this can only be used in the declaration of a function without a return value.

Physical units
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A physical unit in NESTML can be either a simple physical unit or a complex physical unit. A simple physical unit is composed of an optional magnitude prefix and the name of the unit.

The following table lists seven base units, which can be used to specify any physical unit. This idea is based on `the SI units <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units>`__.

+-----------------------+-------------+------------------+
| Quantity              | Unit Name   | NESTML/SI unit   |
+=======================+=============+==================+
| length                | meter       | m                |
+-----------------------+-------------+------------------+
| mass                  | kilogram    | kg               |
+-----------------------+-------------+------------------+
| time                  | second      | s                |
+-----------------------+-------------+------------------+
| electric current      | ampere      | A                |
+-----------------------+-------------+------------------+
| temperature           | kelvin      | K                |
+-----------------------+-------------+------------------+
| amount of substance   | mole        | mol              |
+-----------------------+-------------+------------------+
| luminous intensity    | candela     | cd               |
+-----------------------+-------------+------------------+

Any other physical unit can be expressed as a combination of these seven units. These other units are called derived units. NESTML provides a concept for the derivation of new physical units, i.e., by combining simple units (consisting of a prefix and an SI unit), the user is able to create arbitrary physical units.

Units can have at most one of the following magnitude prefixes:

+----------+-----------+-----------------+----------+-----------+-----------------+
| Factor   | SI Name   | NESTML prefix   | Factor   | SI Name   | NESTML prefix   |
+==========+===========+=================+==========+===========+=================+
| 10^-1    | deci      | d               | 10^1     | deca      | da              |

| 10^-24   | yocto     | y               | 10^24    | yotta     | Y               |
+----------+-----------+-----------------+----------+-----------+-----------------+

Simple physical units can be combined to complex units. For this, the operators , ``*`` (multiplication), ``/`` (division), ``**`` (power) and ``()`` (parenthesis) can be used. An example could be

.. code-block:: nestml

   mV*mV*nS**2/(mS*pA)

Units of the form ``<unit> ** -1`` can also be expressed as ``1/<unit>``. For example

.. code-block:: nestml

   (ms*mV)**-1

is equivalent to

.. code-block:: nestml

   1/(ms*mV)

NESTML also supports the usage of named derived-units such as Newton, Henry or lux:

Here, except for Ohm, the symbol of the unit has to be used in the model, e.g.:

.. code-block:: nestml

   x = 10 N * 22 Ohm / 0.5 V


Type and unit checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NESTML checks type correctness of all expressions. This also applies to assignments, declarations with an initialization and function calls. NESTML supports conversion of ``integer``\ s to ``real``\ s. A conversion from unit-typed to ``real``-typed variables is also possible. However, these conversions are reported as warnings. Finally, there is no conversion between numeric types and boolean or string types.


Basic elements of the embedded programming language
---------------------------------------------------


Documentation string
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each model may be documented by a block of text in reStructuredText format. Following `PEP 257 "Docstring Conventions" <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_, this block should be enclosed in triple double quotes (``""" ... """``) and appear directly before the definition of the neuron. For example:

.. code-block:: nestml

   """
   my_custom_neuron: My customized version of a Hodgkin-Huxley model
   #################################################################

   Description
   +++++++++++

   Long description follows here. We can typeset LaTeX math:

   .. math::

      E = mc^2

   """
   model my_custom_neuron:
       # [...]

This documentation block is rendered as HTML on the :doc:`models library <models_library/index>`.


Comments in the model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the character ``#`` appears as the first character on a line (ignoring whitespace), the remainder of that line is allowed to contain any comment string. Comments are not interpreted as part of the model specification, but when a comment is placed in a strategic location, it will be printed into the generated NEST code.

Example of single or multi-line comments:

.. code-block:: nestml

   var1 real # single line comment

   # This is
   #  a comment
   #   over several lines.

To enable NESTML to recognize which element a comment belongs to, the following approach has to be used: there should be no white line separating the comment and its target and the comment should be placed before the target line or on the same line as the target. For example:

.. code-block:: nestml

   # I am a comment of the membrane potential
   V_m mV = -55 mV # I am a comment of the membrane potential

   # I am not a comment of the membrane potential. A white line separates us.

If a comment shall be attached to an element, no white lines are allowed.

.. code-block:: nestml

   # I am not a comment of the membrane potential.

   # I am a comment of the membrane potential.
   V_m mV = -55 mV # I am a comment of the membrane potential

Whitelines are therefore used to separate comment targets:

.. code-block:: nestml

   # I am a comment of the membrane potential.
   V_m mV = -55 mV

   # I am a comment of the resting potential.
   V_rest mV = -60 mV


Declarations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Declarations are composed of a non-empty list of comma separated names. A valid name starts with a letter, an underscore or the dollar character. Furthermore, it can contain an arbitrary number of letters, numbers, underscores and dollar characters. Formally, a valid name satisfies the following regular expression:

::

    ( 'a'..'z' | 'A'..'Z' | '_' | '$' )( 'a'..'z' | 'A'..'Z' | '_' | '0'..'9' | '$' )+

Names of functions and input ports must also satisfy this pattern. The type of the declaration can be any of the valid NESTML types. The type of the initialization expression must be compatible with the type of the declaration.


::

    <list_of_comma_separated_names> <type> (= initialization_expression)?

.. code-block:: nestml

    a, b, c real = -0.42
    d integer = 1
    n integer # default value is 0
    e string = "foo"
    f mV = -2e12 mV

It is legal to define a variable (or kernel, or parameter) with the same name as a physical unit, but this could lead to confusion. For example, defining a variable with name ``b`` creates an ambiguity with the physical unit ``b``, a unit of surface area. In these cases, a warning is issued when the model is processed. The variable (or kernel, and parameter) definitions will then take precedence when resolving symbols: all occurrences of the symbol in the model will be resolved to the variable rather than the unit.

For example, the following model will result in one warning and one error:

.. code-block:: nestml

   model test_neuron:
       state:
           ms mA = 42 mA   # redefine "ms" (from milliseconds unit to variable name)
           foo s = 0 s     # foo has units of time (seconds)

       update:
           ms = 1 mA    # WARNING: Variable 'ms' has the same name as a physical unit!
           foo = 42 ms  # ERROR: Actual type different from expected. Expected: 's', got: 'mA'!

Assignments
~~~~~~~~~~~

NESTML supports simple or compound assignments. The left-hand side of the assignment is always a variable. The right-hand side can be an arbitrary expression of a type which is compatible with the left-hand side.

Examples for valid assignments for a numeric variable ``n`` are

* simple assignment: ``n = 10``
* compound sum: ``n += 10`` which corresponds to ``n = n + 10``
* compound difference: ``n -= 10`` which corresponds to ``n = n - 10``
* compound product: ``n *= 10`` which corresponds to ``n = n * 10``
* compound quotient: ``n /= 10`` which corresponds to ``n = n / 10``

Vectors
~~~~~~~

Variables can be declared as vectors to store an array of values. They can be declared in the ``parameters``, ``state``, and ``internals`` blocks. See :ref:`Block types` for more information on different types of blocks available in NESTML.

The declaration of a vector variable consists of the name of the variable followed by the size of the vector enclosed in ``[`` and ``]``. The vector must be initialized with a default value and all the values in the vector will be initialized to the specified initial value. For example,

.. code-block:: nestml

   parameters:
       g_ex [20] mV = 10mV

Here, ``g_ex`` is a vector of size 20 and all the elements of the vector are initialized to 10mV. Note that the vector index always starts from 0.
Size of the vector can be a positive integer or an integer variable previously declared in either ``parameters`` or ``internals`` block. For example, an integer variable named ``ten`` declared in the ``parameters`` block can be used to specify the size of the vector variable ``g_ex`` as:

.. code-block:: nestml

   state:
       g_ex [ten] mV = 10mV
       x [12] real = 0.

   parameters:
       ten integer = 10

If the size of a vector is a variable (as ``ten`` in the above example), the vector will be resized if the value of size variable changes during the simulation. On the other hand, the vector cannot be resized if the size is a fixed integer value.
Vector variables can be used in expressions as an array with an index. For example,

.. code-block:: nestml

   state:
       g_ex [ten] mV = 10mV
       x[15] real = 0.

   parameters:
       ten integer = 10

   update:
       integer j = 0
       g_ex[2] = -55. mV
       x[j] = g_ex[2]
       j += 1

Functions
~~~~~~~~~

Functions can be used to write repeatedly used code blocks only once. They consist of the function name, the list of parameters and an optional return type, if the function returns a value to the caller.

::

    function <name>(<list_of_arguments>) <return_type>?:
        <statements>

e.g.:

.. code-block:: nestml

   function divide(a real, b real) real:
       return a/b

To use a function, it has to be called. A function call is composed of the function name and the list of required parameters. The returned value (if any) can be directly assigned to a variable of the corresponding type.

::

    <function_name>(<list_of_arguments>)

e.g.

.. code-block:: nestml

   x = max(a*2, b/2)

Predefined functions

Return statement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``return`` keyword can only be used inside of the ``function`` block. Depending on the return type (if any), it is followed by an expression of that type.

::

    return (<expression>)?

e.g.

.. code-block:: nestml

   if a > b:
       return a
   else:
       return b

Print function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``print`` and ``println`` functions print a string to the standard output, with ``println`` printing a line break at the end. They can be used in the ``update`` block. See :ref:`Block types` for more information on the ``update`` block.

Example:

.. code-block:: nestml

    update:
        print("Hello World")
        ...
        println("Another statement")

Variables defined in the model can be printed by enclosing them in ``{`` and ``}``. For example, variables ``V_m`` and ``V_thr`` used in the model can be printed as:

.. code-block:: nestml

    update:
        ...
        print("A spike event with membrane voltage: {V_m}")
        ...
        println("Membrane voltage {V_m} is less than the threshold {V_thr}")


Predefined variables and constants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following variables and constants are predefined in NESTML and can be used out of the box. No variables can be defined in NESTML that have the same name.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 30

   * - Name
     - Description
   * - ``t``
     - The current simulation time (read only)
   * - ``e``
     - Euler's constant (2.718...)
   * - ``inf``
     - Floating point infinity


Control structures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To control the flow of execution, NESTML supports loops and conditionals.

Loops
^^^^^

The start of the ``while`` loop is composed of the keyword ``while`` followed by a boolean condition and a colon. It executes the statements inside the block as long as the given boolean expression evaluates to ``true``.

::

    while <boolean_expression>:
        <statements>

e.g.:

.. code-block:: nestml

   x integer = 0
   while x <= 10:
       y = max(3, x)

The ``for`` loop starts with the keyword ``for`` followed by the name of a previously defined variable of type ``integer`` or ``real``. The fist variant uses an ``integer`` stepper variable which iterates over the half-open interval [``lower_bound``, ``upper_bound``) in steps of 1.

::

    for <existing_variable_name> in <lower_bound> ... <upper_bound>:
        <statements>

e.g.:

.. code-block:: nestml

   x integer = 0
   for x in 1 ... 5:
       # <statements>

The second variant uses an ``integer`` or ``real`` iterator variable and iterates over the half-open interval ``[lower_bound, upper_bound)`` with a positive ``integer`` or ``real`` step of size ``step``. It is advisable to choose the type of the iterator variable and the step size to be the same.

::

    for <existing_variable_name> in <lower_bound> ... <upper_bound> step <step>:
        <statements>

e.g.:

.. code-block:: nestml

   x integer
   for x in 1 ... 5 step 2:
       # <statements>

   x real
   for x in 0.1 ... 0.5 step 0.1:
       # <statements>

Conditionals
^^^^^^^^^^^^

NESTML supports different variants of the if-else conditional. The first example shows the ``if`` conditional composed of a single ``if`` block:

::

    if <boolean_expression>:
        <statements>

e.g.:

.. code-block:: nestml

   parameters:
       foo integer = 2
       bar integer = 3

   update:
       if foo < bar:
           # <statements>

The second example shows an if-else block, which executes the ``if_statements`` in case the boolean expression evaluates to true and the ``else_statements`` else.

::

    if <boolean_expression>:
        <if_statements>
    else:
        <else_statements>

e.g.:

.. code-block:: nestml

   update:
       if foo < bar:
           # <if_statements>
       else:
           # <else_statements>

In order to allow grouping a sequence of related ``if`` conditions, NESTML also supports the ``elif``-conditionals. An ``if`` condition can be followed by an arbitrary number of ``elif`` conditions. Optionally, this variant also supports the ``else`` keyword for a catch-all statement.

::

    if <boolean_expression>:
        <if_statements>
    elif <boolean_expression>:
        <elif_statements>
    else:
        <else_statements>

e.g.:

.. code-block:: nestml

   parameters:
       foo integer = 2
       bar integer = 3
       x integer = 4
       y integer = 6

   update:
       if foo < bar:
           # <if_statements>
       elif x > y:
           # <elif_statements>
       else:
           # <else_statements>

Conditionals can also be nested inside of each other.

.. code-block:: nestml

   if foo < bar:
       # <statements>
       if x < y:
           # <statements>

Expressions and operators
-------------------------

Expressions in NESTML can be specified in a recursive fashion.

Terms
~~~~~

All variables, literals, and function calls are valid terms. Variables are names of user-defined or predefined variables (``t``, ``e``).

List of operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For any two valid numeric expressions ``a``, ``b``, boolean expressions ``c``,\ ``c1``,\ ``c2``, and an integer expression ``n`` the following operators produce valid expressions.

Blocks
------

To structure NESTML files, all content is structured in blocks. Blocks begin with a keyword specifying the type of the block followed by a colon. Indentation inside a block is mandatory with a recommended indentation level of 4 spaces. Refer to :ref:`Structure and indentation` for more details. Each of the following blocks must only occur at most once. Some of the blocks are required to occur in every model. The general syntax looks like this:

::

    <block_type> [<args>]:
        ...

Block types
~~~~~~~~~~~

``model <name>`` - The top-level block of a model called ``<name>``. All following blocks are contained in this block.

Within the top-level block, the following blocks may be defined:

- ``parameters`` - This block is composed of a list of variable declarations that are supposed to contain all parameters which remain constant during the simulation, but can vary among different simulations or instantiations of the same model. Parameters cannot be changed from within the model itself; for this, use state variables instead.
- ``internals`` - This block is composed of a list of helper parameters which remain constant during the simulation run and derive from parameters. Therefore, their initialization expression can only reference parameters or other internal variables.
- ``state`` - This block is composed of a list of variable declarations that describe the state of the model which may change over time.
- ``equations`` - This block contains kernel declarations, inline expressions, and differential equations. It will be explained in further detail `later on in the manual <#equations>`__.
- ``input`` - This block is composed of one or more input ports. It will be explained in further detail `later on in the manual <#input>`__.
- ``output`` - Defines which type of event the neuron can send. Currently, only ``spike`` is supported.
- ``update`` - Contains statements that are executed once every simulation timestep (on a fixed grid or from event to event). The length of the timestep is given by the function ``resolution()``. If there are ODEs that need to be integrated in time, statements in this block are responsible for performing the integration by calling ``integrate_odes()``. At the start of the block, the state corresponds to that at time :math:`t`; at the end of the block, the state should have been updated (by the statements) to :math:`t+\texttt{resolution()}`.
- ``onReceive`` - Can be defined for each spiking input port; contains statements that are executed whenever an incoming spike event arrives. Optional event parameters, such as the weight, can be accessed by referencing the input port name. Priorities can optionally be defined for each ``onReceive`` block; these resolve ambiguity in the model specification of which event handler should be called after which, in case multiple events occur at the exact same moment in time on several input ports, triggering multiple event handlers.
- ``onCondition`` - Contains statements that are executed when a particular condition holds. The condition is expressed as a (boolean typed) expression. The advantage of having conditions separate from the ``update`` block is that a root-finding algorithm can be used to find the precise time at which a condition holds, within each (fixed resolution) simulation timestep. This makes the model more generic with respect to the simulator that is used.



Input
-----

A model written in NESTML can be configured to receive two distinct types of input: spikes and continuous-time values.

For more details, on handling inputs in neuron and synapse models, please see :doc:`neurons_in_nestml` and :doc:`synapses_in_nestml`.


Output
------

Each model can only send a single type of event. The type of the event has to be given in the `output` block. Currently, however, only spike output is supported.

.. code-block:: nestml

   output:
       spike


Dynamics and time evolution
---------------------------

We will first define the model in mathematical terms, and then show how to model it with NESTML. The following text is based on [2]_.

Consider a linear, time-invariant system

.. math::

   \dot{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{Ax} + \mathbf{y}

Here, :math:`\mathbf{x}(t)` is the time-dependent state of the system, and :math:`\mathbf{y}(t)` is the time-dependent input to the system. Both :math:`\mathbf{x}` and :math:`\mathbf{y}` are :math:`n`-dimensional column vectors containing real numbers. By substitution of variables, any higher-order linear differential equation is written as a first-order system during processing with the NESTML component ODE-toolbox. A solution to the homogeneous (zero-input) equation :math:`\dot{\mathbf{x}}=A\mathbf{x}` is given by the matrix exponential :math:`x(t) = \exp{\mathbf{A}t}`.

The unique solution of the full equation with initial value :math:`\mathbf{x}(t_0)` is

.. math::
   :label: eq_b

   \mathbf{x}(t) = \exp{\mathbf{A}(t - t_0)}\mathbf{x}(t_0) + \int_{t_0^+}^t \exp{\mathbf{A}(t - \tau)} \mathbf{y}(\tau) d\tau

The first part of the sum is the result of passive propagation of the initial state, wheras the second part represents the input-driven response of the system.  Correspondingly, for a system with no input, the matrix :math:`exp{\mathbf{A}t}` is termed "time-evolution operator" or "propagator". In contrast, for a system with input but zero initial conditions, the same matrix is called the "impulse response" of the system.

Digital simulation means to compute the response :math:`\mathbf{x}(t)` of the system to a prescribed input :math:`\mathbf{y}(t)`  on an evenly sampled grid :math:`t_k = k\cdot \Delta t` where :math:`\Delta t` is a fixed step size and :math:`k` takes only integer values. The function :math:`x(t)` then corresponds to the sequence :math:`x(t_k)` of its samples on the grid. For a special type of input functions, the simulation can be performed in an exact way, avoiding potentially inaccurate and unstable integration methods. To this end, we consider functions :math:`\mathbf{y}(t)` of the form

.. math::

   \mathbf{y}(t) = \sum_k \mathbf{y}(t_k) \delta(t - t_k)

where :math:`\mathbf{y}` is an :math:`n`\ -dimensional vector for each :math:`k`, and :math:`\delta(t)` is the scalar Dirac delta function.

For pulse train inputs which are restricted to the grid,
the temporal evolution of the continuous system (2)
collapses to a discrete matrix equation. Namely, if we let :math:`t_0 = t_k` and :math:`t = t_{k+1}` be two successive points on the grid, the solution to :eq:`eq_b` is

.. math::
   :label: eq_iter

   x(t_{k+1}) = \exp{\mathbf{A}h} \cdot \mathbf{x}(t_k) + \mathbf{y}(t_{k+1})

which can be interpreted as an iteration


::

         y_1   y_2   y_3
          ↓     ↓     ↓
   x_0 → x_1 → x_2 → x_3


Starting with an initial state :math:`y_0` and assuming non-zero input only at :math:`t_k` for :math:`k = 1,2,3,\ldots`, it propagates the exact solution on the grid, step by step. The diagram depicts the dependency of the current output of the system on its previous output and the current input. We refer to the iteration :eq:`eq_b` as the method of "Exact Integration". For a time-invariant system, it is based on the fixed numerical matrix :math:`\exp{\mathbf{A}\cdot\Delta t}`, which has to be computed only once by using appropriate standard numerical algorithms. During code generation, this step is performed by ODE-toolbox.

Example: exponential decay
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a scalar value :math:`x` and no external input:

.. math::

   \dot{x} = -ax

with initial condition :math:`x(0) = x_0`, the solution of this initial value problem is given by

.. math::

   x(t) = x_0\exp{-at}

The iteration yields the sequence

.. math::

   x(t_{k+1}) = \exp{-ah} x(t_k)

Consider now the same system with input:

.. math::

   \dot{x} = -ax + I

As input, we take a pulse train on the grid. The response :math:`x(t)` is then

.. math::

   x(t) = \int_0^t \exp{-a(t - \tau)} I d\tau

The result of a discrete iteration according to :eq:`eq_iter` can be seen as a system which relaxes from its previous state according to its autonomous dynamics, and which then updates its initial conditions to satisfy the input.


Example: integrate-and fire
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. math::

   \dot{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} = \left[\begin{aligned}\tau_\text{syn} & 0\\
   \frac{1}{C_m} & -\frac{1}{\tau_m} \end{aligned}\right]

where the initial conditions are defined at the time that an incoming spike is handled, that is that the variable

.. math::

   \mathbf{x}(0) = \left[\begin{aligned}\Delta I_\text{PSP}\\V_{m,0}\end{aligned}\right]

In a grid-constrained simulation, only delays that are an integer multiple of h can be considered because incoming spikes can be handled only at grid points.

If a neuron emits a spike at time t that has a delay of d, the simulation algorithm waits until all neurons have completed their updates for the integration step (t − h, t] and then delivers the event to its target(s).


Equations
---------

Systems of ODEs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the ``equations`` block one can define a system of differential equations with an arbitrary amount of equations that contain derivatives of arbitrary order. When using a derivative of a variable, say ``V``, one must write: ``V'``. It is then assumed that ``V'`` is the first time derivate of ``V``. The second time derivative of ``V`` is ``V''``, and so on. If an equation contains a derivative of order :math:`n`, for example, :math:`V^{(n)}`, all initial values of :math:`V` up to order :math:`n-1` must be defined in the ``state`` block. For example, if stating

.. code-block:: nestml

   V' = a * V

in the ``equations`` block,

.. code-block:: nestml

   V mV = 0 mV

has to be defined in the ``state`` block. Otherwise, an error message is generated.

The content of spike and continuous time buffers can be used by just using their plain names. NESTML takes care behind the scenes that the buffer location at the current simulation time step is used.

Delay Differential Equations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The differential equations in the ``equations`` block can also be a delay differential equation, where the derivative
at the current time depends on the derivative of a function at previous times. A state variable, say ``foo`` that is
dependent on another state variable ``bar`` at a constant time offset (here, ``delay``) in the past, can be written as

.. code-block:: nestml

   state:
       bar real = -70.
       foo real = 0

   equations:
       bar' = -bar / tau
       foo' = bar(t - delay) / tau

Note that the ``delay`` can be a numeric constant or a constant defined in the ``parameters`` block. In the above example, the ``delay`` variable is defined in the ``parameters`` block as:

.. code-block:: nestml

   parameters:
       tau ms = 3.5 ms
       delay ms = 5.0 ms

For a full example, please refer to the tests at `tests/nest_tests/nest_delay_based_variables_test.py <https://github.com/nest/nestml/blob/master/tests/nest_tests/nest_delay_based_variables_test.py>`_.

.. note::

   - The value of the delayed variable (``bar`` in the above example) returned by the node's ``get()`` function in
     PyNEST is always the non-delayed version, i.e., the value of the derivative of ``bar`` at time ``t``. Similarly, the
     ``set()`` function sets the value of the actual state variable ``bar`` without the ``delay`` into consideration.
   - The ``delay`` variable can be set from PyNEST using the ``set()`` function before running the simulation. Setting the value after the simulation can give rise to unpredictable results and is not currently supported.

.. note::

   - Delay differential equations where the derivative of a variable is dependent on the derivative of the same
     variable at previous times, for example, `The Mackey-Glass equation <http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Mackey-Glass_equation>`_, are not supported currently.
   - Delay differential equations with multiple delay values for the same variable are also not supported.

Inline expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the ``equations`` block, inline expressions may be used to reduce redundancy, or improve legibility in the model code. An inline expression is a named expression, that will be "inlined" (effectively, copied-and-pasted in) when its variable symbol is mentioned in subsequent ODE or kernel expressions. In the following example, the inline expression ``h_inf_T`` is defined, and then used in an ODE definition:

.. code-block:: nestml

   inline h_inf_T real = 1 / (1 + exp((V_m / mV + 83) / 4))
   IT_h' = (h_inf_T * nS - IT_h) / tau_h_T / ms

Because of nested substitutions, inline statements may cause the expressions to grow to large size. In case this becomes a problem, it is recommended to use functions instead.

The ``recordable`` keyword can be used to make inline available to recording devices:

.. code-block:: nestml

   equations:
       ...
       recordable inline V_m mV = V_rel + E_L

An special case is when an inline expression is defined as a simple convolution and marked ``recordable``:

.. code-block:: nestml

   recordable inline I_syn pA = convolve(alpha_kernel, spiking_input_port) * pA

During code generation, one or more state variables are created for each unique combination of (kernel, spike input port) that appears in convolution statements. These state variables keep track of the state of the convolution across time, and can be referenced in the rest of the model, for instance:

.. code-block:: nestml

   update:
     # reset the state of synaptic integration
     I_syn = 0 pA
     I_syn' = 0 * s**-1


Kernel functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A `kernel` is a function of time, or a differential equation, that represents a kernel which can be used in convolutions. For example, an exponentially decaying kernel could be described as a direct function of time, as follows:

.. code-block:: nestml

   kernel g = exp(-t / tau)

with time constant, for example, equal to 20 ms:

.. code-block:: nestml

   parameters:
       tau ms = 20 ms

The start at time :math:`t \geq 0` is an implicit assumption for all kernels.

Equivalently, the same exponentially decaying kernel can be formulated as a differential equation:

.. code-block:: nestml

   kernel g' = -g / tau

In this case, initial values have to be specified in the ``state`` block up to the order of the differential equation, e.g.:

.. code-block:: nestml

   state:
       g real = 1

Here, the ``1`` defines the peak value of the kernel at :math:`t = 0`.

An example second-order kernel is the dual exponential ("alpha") kernel, which can be defined in three equivalent ways.

(1) As a direct function of time:

    .. code-block:: nestml

       kernel g = (e/tau) * t * exp(-t/tau)

(2) As a system of coupled first-order differential equations:

    .. code-block:: nestml

       kernel g' = g$ - g  / tau,
              g$' = -g$ / tau

    with initial values:

    .. code-block:: nestml

       state:
           g real = 0
           g$ real = 1

   Note that the types of both differential equations are :math:`\text{ms}^{-1}`.

(3) As a second-order differential equation:

    .. code-block:: nestml

       kernel g'' = (-2/tau) * g' - 1/tau**2) * g

    with initial values:

    .. code-block:: nestml

       state:
           g real = 0
           g' ms**-1 = e / tau

A Dirac delta impulse kernel can be defined by using the predefined function ``delta``:

.. code-block:: nestml

   kernel g = delta(t)


Solver selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently, there is support for GSL and exact integration. ODEs that can be solved analytically are integrated to machine precision from one timestep to the next. To allow more precise values for analytically solvable ODEs *within* a timestep, the same ODEs are evaluated numerically by the GSL solver. In this way, the long-term dynamics obeys the "exact" equations, while the short-term (within one timestep) dynamics is evaluated to the precision of the numerical integrator.

In the case that the model is solved with the GSL integrator, desired absolute error of an integration step can be adjusted with the ``gsl_error_tol`` parameter in a ``SetStatus`` call. The default value of ``gsl_error_tol`` is ``1e-3``.


Inside the ``update`` block, the current time can be retrieved via the predefined, global variable ``t``. The statements executed in the block are reponsible for updating the state of the model from the "current" time ``t`` to the next timestep ``t + resolution()``.

Integrating the ODEs needs to be triggered explicitly in NESTML by using the ``integrate_odes()`` in the ``update`` block. The reason to make this explicit is that, although a certain sequence of steps is recommended in general, making these statements explicit forces the modeler to be explicit and precise, rather than leaving implementation details up to the simulation platform, which could cause variations in behavior of the same model on different platforms. For instance, depending on the sequence of operations, we might want to process the spikes that were received in the last time interval, which typically would apply delta impulses to the state variables, before integrating the model ODEs over the same time interval---or to do it exactly vice versa. This allows a wider range of model behaviour to be reproduced from the literature.

The ``integrate_odes()`` function numerically integrates the differential equations defined in the ``equations`` block. Integrating the ODEs from one timestep to the next has to be explicitly carried out in the model by calling the ``integrate_odes()`` function. If no parameters are given, all ODEs in the model are integrated. Integration can be limited to a given set of ODEs by giving their left-hand side state variables as parameters to the function, for example ``integrate_odes(V_m, I_ahp)`` if ODEs exist for the variables ``V_m`` and ``I_ahp``. In this example, these variables are integrated simultaneously (as one single system of equations). This is different from calling ``integrate_odes(V_m)`` and then ``integrate_odes(I_ahp)`` in that the second call would use the already-updated values from the first call. Variables not included in the call to ``integrate_odes()`` are assumed to remain constant (both inside the numeric solver stepping function as well as from before to after the call).

Note that the dynamical equations that correspond to convolutions are always updated, regardless of whether ``integrate_odes()`` is called. The affected state variables are updated when the ``process_spikes()`` function is called for that input port. See also :ref:`Integrating spiking input` and :ref:`Integration order`.


Integration order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The recommended update sequence for a spiking neuron model is shown below, which is optimal ("gives the fewest surprises") in the case the simulator uses a minimum synaptic transmission delay (this includes NEST). In this sequence, first the subthreshold dynamics are evaluated (that is, ``integrate_odes()`` is called; in the simplest case, all equations are solved simultaneously) and only afterwards, incoming spikes are processed.

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clinssen/nestml/integrate_specific_odes/doc/fig/integration_order.png
   :alt: Integration order. Modified after [1]_, their Fig. 10.2.

The numeric results of a typical are shown below. When the neuron is being updated from ``t`` to ``t + resolution()``, the subthreshold dynamics step is performed first, and then the neuron state is modified to include the spikes. The effect of the spike at time ``t`` only become visible at ``t + resolution()``. This is illustrated in the figure below, which shows a comparison between the "true" solution in blue (middle and bottom panels) to a spike arriving at 2 ms (top panel) for an integrate-and-fire neuron with an exponentially decaying postsynaptic kernel. The spike increments the value of the postsynaptic current (middle panel), which appears as a term in the membrane potential ODE (bottom panel). The effect of the spike becomes visible at the end of the timestep because ``process_spikes()`` has incremented the postsynaptic current, but the effect of the spike on the membrane potential only becomes visible one timestep later (at 3 ms) because the new value of the postsynaptic current is only taken into account in the subthreshold dynamics at the next timestep.

       spikes pA/s <- spike

Emitting spikes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Calling the ``emit_spike()`` function in the ``update`` block results in firing a spike to all target neurons and devices time stamped with the simulation time at the end of the time interval ``t + resolution()``.


Predefined time-related functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To retrieve some fundamental simulation parameters, two special functions are built into NESTML:

-  ``resolution()`` can be used inside the ``update`` block, and returns the length of the current integration timestep that is to be taken. This can correspond to a fixed simulation resolution grid, but depending on the simulation platform, it can also be a jump from spike event to spike event.
-  ``steps(interval)`` takes one parameter of type ``ms`` and returns the number of simulation steps in the current simulation resolution. This only makes sense for simulations for which a fixed simulation time grid is defined.

These functions can be used to implement custom buffer lookup logic, but should be used with care.

When using ``resolution()``, it is recommended to use the function call directly in the code, rather than assigning to to a parameter. This makes the model more robust in case of non-constant timestep. For example:

.. code-block:: nestml

   state:
       x real = 1.

   parameters:
       h ms = resolution()   # !! NOT RECOMMENDED.

   update:
       # update from t to t + resolution()
       x *= exp(-resolution() / tau)   # let x' = -x / tau
                                       # evolve the state of x one timestep


Guards
------

Variables which are defined in the ``state`` and ``parameters`` blocks can optionally be secured through guards. These guards are checked when the variable is assigned a value.

::

   block:
       <declaration> [[<boolean_expression>]]

e.g.:

.. code-block:: nestml

   parameters:
       t_ref ms = 5 ms [[t_ref >= 0 ms]] # refractory period cannot be negative
